Water Problems Image Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for training a deep learning model to classify water images using TensorFlow and Keras. The model can distinguish between water-related and non-water images. Additionally, it includes some image preprocessing and data augmentation steps.

1.Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib

2.Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the code performs some data preprocessing steps, including:

Removing invalid image files with unsupported extensions.

Resizing images to a uniform size (256x256 pixels).

Normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1].

Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. Training

The classification model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for 20 epochs.


You can train the model by running the following code:

model.fit(train, epochs=20, validation_data=val, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])

4.Evaluation

The code evaluates the trained model using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics on a test dataset. The results are printed to the console.

5.Inference

You can use the trained model for inference on new images. Load an image, preprocess it (resize and normalize), and then use the model to make predictions.

6.Contribution 

Feel free to contribute to this project by opening issues or pull requests. We welcome any improvements, bug fixes, or additional features.
